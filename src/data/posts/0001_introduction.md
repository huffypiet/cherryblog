----------

CherryBlog is brand new blogging software written in Python and using the CherryPy framework, hence it's name.

The templates used in the first release are the free templates found on startbootstrap.com.  The purpose of using these templates is of course that the site should easily accessible on smart devices. And they basically look very good out-of-the-box.

## Inspiration

The project is inspired by JBake, a static site generator I used previously. I have decided to start my own project because:

- JBake is not so much alive, it seems.
- JBake is written in Java or Groovy, whereas I have switched programming to Python lately.

For software written in Python, I looked at Pelican.  But for some reason I don't feel at home with it.
