## Introduction

As a developer, I want to share things with the world and run a blog. Finding the right blogging software is difficult if you limit the choices for the final deployment.

- Static website that can be hosted anywhere behind an Apache or Nginx server.
- No database to hold the content
- Extensible with themes, features, ...

I started using JBake quite some time ago, but the project does not seem very lively.  

Furthermore, I have switched from the Java (-alikes) world to Python.  In Python, the only thing I tried was Pelican.  Pelican however was not what I needed for another website (my personal site as freelancer) and I found CherryPy as framework.  

I was able to make my personal site in just a matter of hours (the content and template was already available from JBake).  When using CherryPy, I saw a possibility to write something similar like JBake in Python.  

For now, I will not create a static website, but I will run a website with data coming from Markdown files, YAML files, ...  

I wil make connectors to databases maybe one day, but not for now.  And, in a later phase, I may consider "building" to an static website.  

### Status

This project has just started.
